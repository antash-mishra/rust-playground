## Rust Programs
	
Use `rustc` to execute.

##### Programs from books <br>
- The Rust programming language
- Rust by Example 
- Some are my own
  > Use `cargo` for projects matrix and minigrep

##### For **libp2pexamples** folder 


Steps: For `/examples/ping.rs` 

> `cargo run --example ping` in Terminal 1
>
> It will print the PeerId and the listening address 
>
> Eg. `Listening on "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/9045"`  
>
> `cargo run --example ping -- /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/9045` in Terminal 2
>	
> Two nodes are then connected

**Same process will be used for `/examples/chat.rs`**
